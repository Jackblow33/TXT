f your Arch Linux computer with an AMD GPU isn't waking from sleep, ensure your system is fully updated and the AMD microcode package is installed, as this can resolve issues with suspend/resume. Also, check for specific driver README instructions for enabling power management services.
Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential solutions:
1. System Updates and AMD Microcode:

    Update your system: Ensure you have the latest updates installed, as bug fixes and improvements can address sleep issues.
    Check for AMD microcode: Verify that the amdgpu-driver package is installed, and if not, install it. Also, confirm that the amd-ucode package is installed, as it contains important microcode updates for AMD GPUs.
    Command to check installation: pacman -Ss amdgpu and pacman -Ss amd-ucode
    Command to install: sudo pacman -S amdgpu-driver and sudo pacman -S amd-ucode

2. Power Management Services:

    Check driver README:
    Refer to the README file for your AMD GPU driver for instructions on enabling power management services and settings for suspend/resume.
    Enable relevant services:
    For Arch Linux with systemd, you can enable a service with systemctl enable <service_name>, e.g., systemctl enable amdgpu-driver.
    Example:
    If your driver has specific services for handling suspend/resume, enable them as described in the README.
